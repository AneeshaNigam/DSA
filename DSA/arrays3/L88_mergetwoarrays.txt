In this question we are given two sorted arrays that we have to merge in such a way that the resultant array is also sorted


we solved it using 3 pointer method and a temprorary vector

we used 1 pointer for the first sorted array :- i
we used 1 pointer for the second sorted array :- j
we used 1 pointer for the temprorary sorted array :- k

now we would compare every element of the first and second and keep on adding the smaller elements to the temprorary vector
and incrementing values of the pointers accordingly
once one of the arrays are exhausted we will add the remaining elements of either of the vector
after that we would overwrite the elements of the vector that we wish to keep the resultant vector in with the elements of the temprorary vector
