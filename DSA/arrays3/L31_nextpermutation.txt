In this question we have to find the next permutation that's ordered lexiographically
i.e. 123 132 213 231 312 321 the no.s together are in incrementing order

so, for 1243 we would have to find the pivot index that is from where onwards the changes need to be done

in order to find the pivot index we would first find out which left element is lesser than it's right element

after finding the index we would reverse the rest of the array afterwards the pivot index

and then swap the pivot index element and it's succeding element

then we will end up having the next permutation of the given no.
